= Spring Cloud Contract Workshops

This documentation will allow you to go through Spring Cloud Contract Workshops by completing
a series of tasks that will teach you the basic and more advanced concept behind Consumer Driven Contracts
and Spring Cloud Contract as such.

== Workshop setup

The repository mostly consists of pairs of `producer` and `consumer` applications that show
different use cases of Spring Cloud Contract. The initial state of the repository
is such that all the examples are working and the tests are passing. In order for you to prepare
the repository so it has only the basic pieces of code set up execute this Gradle command

[source,groovy]
----
./gradlew prepareForWorkshops
----

This command will remove most of the code / contracts / project setup so that you can start
with the workshops.

TIP: Whenever your lost - don't worry. It's enough to check what's there in the `master` branch
where all of the examples are ready and working.

TIP: You can start with any task - you don't have to do them in the provided order.

== Workshop resources

- Introduction to Consumer Driven Contracts
- Introduction to Spring Cloud Contract

== Workshop tasks

- Contracts on the producer side (single person teams)
  * more sophisticated DSL manipulations (regexs, code execution, referencing request from response)
  * working with stub and test matchers
  * contracts representing scenarios (stateful stubs)
  * creating a library with common code shareable between teams
  * stubbing out service discovery
